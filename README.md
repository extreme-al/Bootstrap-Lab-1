# Bootstrap-Lab-1

This is a project to go with the Microsoft edX Introduction to Bootstrap, course Dev203X.

It's not a perfect attempt--the columns fly all over when you open and close the window and
I would never release it to the public--but it is pretty attractive for a first project in Bootstrap (that worked at all), and
has little or no outright theft from other projects, and the files seem to be in the righ
places.

One of the challenges with Visual Studio going all the way back is that before you know it
your project is a jumble of files all scattered around.  This project was carefully built
to avoid that BS.

One thing to look at is alignment of div tags, which look funny in VS but align just fine in 
NP++.  If you try to line them up, you get div errors.
